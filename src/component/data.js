    ques: "How do DEFI CONNECT CREDIT works?",
    ans: `DeFi Connect Credit operates as a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that tokenizes traditional assets, allowing users to invest in a variety of assets without direct ownership. It employs smart contracts for the creation of synthetic tokens, backed by collateral. Users can deposit crypto assets as collateral to access a credit line, trade synthetic tokens, and participate in decentralized investment funds.`,
  },
  {
    id: 1,
    ques: "How quickly do i get money?",
    ans: `Upon approval, users can access their credit line almost instantly. The funds are typically available within 24 hours, providing a quick and efficient borrowing experience.`,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    ques: "What is the interest rate?",
    ans: `The interest rate varies based on the user's Loyalty Tier, determined by the ratio of the native token (or other specified criteria) against the total portfolio balance. Users with higher Loyalty Tiers enjoy lower interest rates, ranging from 7.9% to 15.9%.`,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    ques: "What is the loan-to-value (LTV)?",
    ans: `The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio expresses the proportion of the loan amount to the value of the collateral. It is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the collateral value and expressing the result as a percentage. LTV is a key factor in determining the user's risk and eligibility for borrowing.`,
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    ques: `What is the value of my collateral changes before i repay my credit line?`,
    ans: `If the value of the collateral changes, it may impact the user's Loan-to-Value ratio. To manage this, users can add more collateral, repay a portion of the credit line, or take other actions to maintain a healthy LTV ratio.`,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    ques: `How does DEFI CONNECT CREDIT keep my collateral safe?`,
    ans: `DEFI CONNECT CREDIT employs advanced security measures, including cold wallets for storing crypto assets, multi-signature protocols, and regular security audits. These measures are designed to protect user collateral from potential vulnerabilities and ensure a secure platform for users.`,
